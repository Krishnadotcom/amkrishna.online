      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hi !! I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Cybersecurity at the University
        of West London and working as a Cybersecurity Researcher with Encrypt
        Bytes. I’m passionate about building secure web applications, exploring
        penetration testing, and creating automated security tools—all while
        juggling my favorite coding languages like Python, JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS, Django, and more across Linux and Windows. I really enjoy breaking
        down complex tech stuff into simple, clear ideas and working with people
        from different backgrounds. But cybersecurity isn’t my only canvas! As a
        passionate artist, I find inspiration in drawing and painting, bringing
        the same creativity and attention to detail to both my art and my code.
        Currently, I’m also deepening my curiosity in machine learning, eager to
        see how this technology can make security smarter and more adaptive.
        Whether I’m sketching a landscape or solving a real-world security
        problem, I approach every challenge with creativity, curiosity, and a
        love for continuous learning—always aiming to bridge the gap between art
        and technology in my journey..
